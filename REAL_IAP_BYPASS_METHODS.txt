REAL IN-APP PURCHASE BYPASS METHODS
===================================

1. CLIENT-SIDE VALIDATION BYPASS
- Apps that only validate purchases locally
- Method: Patch validation functions to always return true
- Tools: APKTool, smali editing, Xposed modules
- Success rate: High on poorly designed apps

2. NETWORK TRAFFIC INTERCEPTION
- Intercept HTTPS requests between app and payment server
- Method: Man-in-the-middle with modified responses
- Tools: mitmproxy, Burp Suite, Charles Proxy
- Requirement: Root access or system certificate

3. MEMORY MANIPULATION
- Modify app memory while running
- Method: Runtime code injection, function hooking
- Tools: Frida, GameGuardian, Cheat Engine
- Requirement: Root access

4. GOOGLE PLAY BILLING EXPLOITS
- Freedom APK (outdated)
- Lucky Patcher (signature spoofing)
- Market Helper (fake license responses)

5. REAL-WORLD ATTACK FLOW:
   a) Decompile target APK
   b) Find purchase validation code
   c) Patch to always return "purchased"
   d) Rebuild and sign APK
   e) Install modified version

DEFENSIVE MEASURES:
